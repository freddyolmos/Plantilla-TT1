# Source Quality Rubric

Score each source from 0 to 2 on each criterion:

- Relevance to subsystem (mechanics, control, vision, HMI).
- Technical detail (hardware, algorithm, protocol, metrics).
- Reproducibility (code, CAD, clear methods, datasets).
- Publication strength (journal, conference, thesis repository).
- Recency (prefer 2018+ unless seminal).

Recommended threshold: keep sources with total score >= 6.
